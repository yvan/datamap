datamap
=======

Maps various measured internet data onto a navigable world map.



## Sources:

The CSS SideTab bar was appropriated from this <a href="http://blog.themearmada.com/off-canvas-slide-menu-for-bootstrap/">blog</a>. Then I stripped it down to get rid of all the weird icons they had and added my own buttons and corresponding JS actions on the map.


## Todo:

Add tooltips as we hover over countries.
